#Write a program to read in names and birth dates from a text file. It should then ask you for a name.
#You type one in, and it tells you when that personâ€™s next birthday will be (and, for the truly adventurous, how old they will be).
#The input file should look something like this:
  # def self.foo
    birthdates = {}

        first_comma = first_comma + 1

        first_comma = first_comma + 1
